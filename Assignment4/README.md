# Code refactoring
Refactor the code of your application to follow at least one of the software design patterns
discussed in the lectures. Upload a document with explanation which design pattern you implemented
and why. The refactored code should:


`• Be clear: The code should be easy to read and understand.
• Be consistent: Use the same naming style for variables and methods throughout.
• Have good names: Variables and methods should have clear and meaningful names.
• Be well-documented: Names should explain the code. If not, add short comments to
clarify what the code does or explain unclear method or parameter names.
• Be easy to maintain: The code should be simple to update or improve later.
• Be reusable: Write code that can be used in other parts of the application.
• Avoid repetition: Remove duplicate code by making it more modular.
• Be efficient: Use algorithms that are simple and fast, avoiding unnecessary complexity.`

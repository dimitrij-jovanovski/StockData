## Code refactoring
Refactor the code of your application to follow at least one of the software design patterns
discussed in the lectures. Upload a document with explanation which design pattern you implemented
and why. The refactored code should:


`• Be clear: The code should be easy to read and understand.`

`• Be consistent: Use the same naming style for variables and methods throughout.`

`• Have good names: Variables and methods should have clear and meaningful names.`

`• Be well-documented: Names should explain the code. If not, add short comments to
clarify what the code does or explain unclear method or parameter names.`

`• Be easy to maintain: The code should be simple to update or improve later.`

`• Be reusable: Write code that can be used in other parts of the application.`

`• Avoid repetition: Remove duplicate code by making it more modular.`

`• Be efficient: Use algorithms that are simple and fast, avoiding unnecessary complexity.`

## API/Microservices

`Redo some of the features of your app as microservices that communicate through
APIs. Microservices are small, independent parts of an application that can work on their own.
Take a few features from your app, rebuild them as separate programs, and make sure they can
run independently. Each microservice should be created as its own project. Then, set up
communication between the microservices and the main app using APIs.`

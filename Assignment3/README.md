 # Technical Analysis 
The technical analysis focuses on studying historical stock price and trading volume data
to identify trends and patterns, which can help predict future price movements. For this
analysis, you need to implement and analyze various technical indicators:

  • Oscillators and Moving Averages (MA): Oscillators and Moving Averages are
  technical indicators used to analyze historical price and trading volume data to predict
  future market movements and make buy or sell decisions.
  
  • Select the top 10 technical indicators (5 from the oscillators and 5 from
  the Moving Averages). For each of these indicators, calculate their values based on
  historical stock price data.
  
  • Using these indicators, you must generate signals for the best times to buy or
  sell stocks, i.e., when stock prices reach critical decision points (buy, sell, hold).
  • For each of the selected 10 technical indicators, calculate their values on three different
  time periods: 1 day, 1 week and 1 month. This will give you insights into shortterm, medium-term, and long-term market trends.
  
If you are using Python as your programming language, the pandas library offers convenient
functions for calculating the selected indicators. For example, to calculate Moving Averages
(SMA and EMA), you can use the methods rolling().mean() for SMA and ewm().mean()
for EMA. For oscillators such as RSI, there are libraries like ta (Technical Analysis Library)
that can help you implement these indicators. These tools will enable fast processing and
analysis of data.
For an example of technical analysis, use the stock chart for a given issuer, available at the
following link: https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=NASDAQ%3ATSLA (in this
case Tesla). In the chart’s side panel, under the Technicals section, click on More technicals
to open the technical indicators.

## Technical prototype

Create the technical prototype of your application. Here, itâ€™s enough for your functions to
be connected, that is, it should be possible to move from one screen to another. Build
a technical prototype using the same technologies planned for the final application. The most
important thing for this part is to verify the concept of your application - to determine if
the chosen technologies (programming language, software framework, database) are appropriate
to fulfill the previously defined requirements and whether the team has the skills needed to work
with them.

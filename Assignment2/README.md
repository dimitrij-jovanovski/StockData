## Technical prototype

Create the technical prototype of your application. Here, it’s enough for your functions to
be connected, that is, it should be possible to move from one screen to another. Build
a technical prototype using the same technologies planned for the final application. The most
important thing for this part is to verify the concept of your application - to determine if
the chosen technologies (programming language, software framework, database) are appropriate
to fulfill the previously defined requirements and whether the team has the skills needed to work
with them.
